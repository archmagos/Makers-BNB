# :ocean::ocean: Pirates-BNB (Board 'n Booty) :ocean::ocean:

# Description
Create a web application that allows pirates to list ships for rental to landlubbers (me 'earties!).

# MVP <img align="right" src="./img/screengrab.png" width="250" />

A pirate should be able to name their ship, provide a short description of the ship (rigging, sails etc.) and the price per week. This information should be visible to landlubbers wishing to hire a ship.(see attached image for example from AirBNB)
